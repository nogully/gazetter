# Twitter Gazette
## Project Name: 
Twitter Gazette / Gazetter

#### Project Pitch
- Love the news, but hate the newsfeed?  
- The Twitter Gazette is for people who like to read the news through Twitter and yet find the newsfeed overwhelming. For every user, the Gazette will curate their most relevant newsworthy tweets from the Twitter API based on features such as: likes, retweets, credentials, proximity, etc. 
- The Gazette will pull in tweet content as headlines for a "front page" of a newspaper that is independent of news outlets. Ideally it will have sections like a traditional newspaper, such as Local News. 
- The desktop design will mimic that of a print newspaper. The mobile site will have some of the same flourishes as the desktop but be optimized for people on the go.
